# How to Get Help

With all the moving pieces, it can be hard to know where to turn for help. Here are some options:

To get software problems fixed on the hub - [CryoInTheCloud hub-image repo issues page](https://github.com/CryoInTheCloud/hub-image/issues)

To have changes made to the CryoCloud JupyterBook - [CryoInTheCloud hub-image repo issues page](https://github.com/CryoInTheCloud/CryoCloudWebsite/issues)

To ask general cloud computing, software, or open-source science questions to the broad open science community - [Pangeo Discourse](https://discourse.pangeo.io/c/science/icesat-2/16)

To ask questions about coding, data access, CryoCloud info or events, or anything else from the CryoCloud community - [CryoCloud Slack](http://cryospherecloud.slack.com)
